# Hackathon Beginner Survival Manual

So you came to a hackathon, but the stuff people are doing is a few steps above your current skill level. Don't despair! Learning how people make amazing things is a very productive use of your time at this event, and someone should be available in person or on Stack Overflow to help if you get stuck.
